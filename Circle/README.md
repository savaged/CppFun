# Circle 

## Aim

Some fun with C++ aimed at helping me learn and improve.

Also, I hope to receive constructive feedback from reviews.


## Usage

Whilst this is designed for learning and fun it can be used to plot a circle.

### Tools

* Build: `make`
* Graphing: `gnuplot` then `plot 'coords.csv' with lines` after running `plot > coords.csv`.

### Configuration

* The R (radius), H & K (centre coordinates) are defined in the `include/config.h` file.


## TODO

* Add gtkmm UI
* Spin off another project to create a clock
